# Design Patterns

## Architectural v Desgin

### Design

Low-level and concrete.
At the class level
addressed how classes are instantiated, structured, and orchestrated.

### Architectural

High-level and abstract
Address global concerns, such as security, perforance, maintainablity, etc.

These are called quality attributes.

## Impact of design patterns

Local
Ex: singleton -limits the number of objects instatiated from the same class, which has no affect on the global space of the program.

## Impact of architectural patterns

Global
Ex: model-view-controller (MVC)
