# Inheritance

Establishes relationship between parent and children

## Child class

Keeps the attributes and methods of its parent
Adds new attributes or methods of its own
Overides the existing methods of its parent

Ex: Pet class: Dog, Cat. speak() is used to create the dog sound and the cat sound.

# Polymorphism

Relies on inheritance
Allows child classes to be instantiated and treated as the same type as its parent. Enables a parent class to be manifested into any of its child classes.
Eample: User of the pet class: Doesn't know if the object is cat or dog until runtime. Because the speak() (method) is hidden until invoked.
