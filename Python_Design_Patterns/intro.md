  3. lower cost and higher quality.

## History

Chistopher Alexander - Architect
Picked up by developers later

## Types

* Creational
* Structural
* Behavorial

### Creational

create objects in a systematic way

#### Benefits

Flexibility - Different subtypes of objects from the same class at runtime

### Structural

Establishes useful relationshjips between software components in certain configurations.
Goal: accomplish functional and nonfunctional requirements.
Different goals yield different structures.
